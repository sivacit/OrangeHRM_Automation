Feature: Login Functionality of OrangeHRM
     As a user
     In order to access the dashboard
     I want to be able to login with valid and invalid credentials

     Scenario: Successful Login with Valid Credentials
       Given I navigate to the login page at "https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login"
       When I enter "admin" as username
           And I enter "admin123" as password
       And I click on the 'Login' button
       Then I should be redirected to the dashboard page

     Scenario: Invalid Login with Incorrect Credentials
       Given I navigate to the login page at "https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login"
       When I enter an invalid username
           And I enter an invalid password
       And I click on the 'Login' button
       Then I should see an error message indicating invalid credentials
