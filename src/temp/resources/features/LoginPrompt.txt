Feature: Login Functionality for OrangeHRM Website
  As a user, I want to be able to log in to the OrangeHRM website with valid and invalid credentials
  So that I can access the dashboard or receive an error message accordingly.

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the OrangeHRM login page
    When I enter "admin" as username and "admin123" as password
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard

  Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials
    Given I am on the OrangeHRM login page
    When I enter an invalid username and password
    And I click the login button
    Then I should see an error message "Invalid Login"
