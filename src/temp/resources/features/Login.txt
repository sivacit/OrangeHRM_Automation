Feature: Login Functionality for OrangeHRM website
  As a user, I want to be able to log in to the OrangeHRM website so that I can access its features

  Scenario Outline: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page of the "<url>"
    When I enter "username" as "<username>" and "password" as "<password>"
    And I click 'Sign In' button
    Then I should be logged in successfully

    Examples:
      | url                | https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login |
      | username           | admin                                                              |
      | password           | admin123                                                            |

  Scenario Outline: Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials
    Given I am on the login page of the "<url>"
    When I enter "username" as "<invalidUsername>" and "password" as "<invalidPassword>"
    And I click 'Sign In' button
    Then I should not be able to log in successfully
