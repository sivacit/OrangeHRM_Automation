Write a Cucumber BDD feature file for the login functionality of the website:
https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login.

The feature file should include:

A successful login scenario with username admin and password admin123, verifying redirection to the dashboard.
An invalid login scenario where incorrect credentials are entered, verifying an error message appears.
Use standard Gherkin syntax with Feature, Scenario, Given, When, And, and Then steps. Do not include explanations, implementation details, or any text outside the feature file itself.
