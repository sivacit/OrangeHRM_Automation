Write a Cucumber BDD feature file for updating the profile on the website:
https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/pim/viewPersonalDetails/empNumber/7.

The feature file should include:

A successful profile update scenario where the user updates the first name, middle name, and last name, then saves the changes.
A scenario where the user tries to update the profile but leaves a required field empty, verifying an error message appears.
Use standard Gherkin syntax with Feature, Scenario, Given, When, And, Then steps. Do not include explanations, implementation details, or any text outside the feature file itself.
